Tenka: Zzz... Zzz...

Amana: This one-piece is cute...
Ehehe... Tenka-chan sure sleeps a lot.

Chiyuki: Yes. It looks like she's dozing peacefully.

Tenka: Zzz... Zzz... Huh?

Amana: Good morning Tenka-chan.

Chiyuki: Good morning.

Tenka: G-Good morning... I laid down and fell asleep without meaning to...

Amana: Tenka-chan looked so cute when she's asleep (alternatively “Tenka-chan’s sleeping face is so cute”)! You were like a sleeping angel.

Tenka: A-An angel? But Tenka is just Tenka...

Amana: That's not true! You were super cute!

Chiyuki: I felt happy just watching you sleeping♪

Amana: Me too! It’s amazing how you can fall asleep anywhere though.

Tenka: But taking naps... feels nice...
It doesn't matter where...

Amana: Even at home, you're always napping.

Tenka: Different napping spots have different kinds of niceness to them.
Even at home, napping in your bedroom feels completely different from napping in the living room...

Chiyuki: I see! In that case, which is your number one recommended napping spot?

Tenka: Eh? I'm not sure... I've never thought about it... Um...
Napping at home is relaxing and you can nap as long as you’d like...
But the office sofa is quite nice too... I like to take a nap there after lessons...
Oh, and if it's sunny, I like to nap outside where it's warm...

Chiyuki: I see! Tenka-chan is quite the expert on the different ways to enjoy napping.

Amana: Listening to Tenka-chan has made Amana want to take a nap now!

Tenka: Then...  how about we nap together... sometime...

Amana: Why not? Napping together sounds like it might be a novel experience.

Chiyuki: Sounds great!

Tenka: Nihehe... Oh!
There's somewhere where Tenka always wanted to try napping in...

Amana: Eh~? Where, where?

Tenka: Um... a hammock...

Amana: Ooh~ I see! You see them on TV a lot, don't you? Sounds fun!

Tenka: Swaying from side to side as you fall asleep sounds nice...
But I've never actually seen one...

Chiyuki: Nor have I... It's not every day that you come across a hammock.

Tenka: I thought I'd like to try it...
So that's why... I thought we could... 
try sleeping in a hammock together... if that's okay...

Amana: Yeah, that sounds really fun!!

Chiyuki: The three of us swaying in a hammock... It does sound fun!

Tenka: Nihehe... Tenka thinks so too...

Amana: But where could we find a hammock?

Chiyuki: Oh, that reminds me! I've heard that there are cafés where you can sleep in hammocks...

Amana: Such cafés exist?! Maybe there's one nearby. Let's go look!

Tenka: Hammock... Nihehe... Swaying, swaying... It must feel nice...

Amana: Not something you can experience in a plain-old futon, is it? I guess we'll be sleeping together, then?

Chiyuki: That sounds really fun!

Tenka: Fuwa... I didn't know they had cafes this big...

Amana: If it's for you, Tenka-chan, Amana will definitely find it☆

Tenka: Na-chan! Thank you!
Sleeping together... Nihehe, I can't wait...


Amana: Is Tenka-chan still not here? I wonder if Producer-san has arrived yet.

Chiyuki: Yeah, I'm a bit worried.
Producer-san said he'd be picking her up so we shouldn't worry but...

Amana: Amana would’ve come with Tenka-chan if Amana didn’t have meetings scheduled...
If we don't get started soon we might be late...

Chiyuki: Oh... It's from Producer-san.
Hello. It's Kuwayama speaking. Yes... Yes... I see!
Excellent. We'll be waiting.

Amana: What did Producer-san say?

Chiyuki: He said he's on the way and should be arriving shortly.

Amana: Phew! We should be able to make it time then.

Chiyuki: But apparently Tenka-chan overslept and didn't have time to prepare...
We need to get ready to receive Tenka-chan as soon as she arrives!

Amana: Ehehe, absolutely.


Tenka: A-Awwuuu... N-Na-chan, Chiyuki-san, I'm sorry... Tenka's still in pajamas... I can't go to work like this...

Chiyuki: Good morning, Tenka-chan. Worry not, for we're here to help.

Amana: Tenka-chan, over here! We're ready for you☆

Tenka: O-Okay...
Um... Um, Tenka is... How should... What's happening...

Chiyuki: It's okay. Have a seat. I'll start by doing your hair.
Wow... Tenka-chan's hair is so beautiful...

Tenka: I-Is it...?

Amana: I know right? She uses the same shampoo as me☆
Tenka-chan, open your mouth. I'm going to brush your teeth, okay?

Tenka: U-Uh... Fuwa...

Chiyuki: And done. Doesn't your hair feel good?

Amana: Wow, Chiyuki, you're amazing! Tenka-chan is super cute!


Chiyuki: Alright, we're all ready! Let's go off to work!

Tenka: W-Will we make it...?

Amana: Don't worry, we’ll definitely make it!

Tenka: Thank goodness... If Na-chan says so... everything will be okay...


Tenka: T-Thank you for your hard work...

Amana: You too~☆ It's good that it went smoothly.

Chiyuki: Yes. Good job, Amana-chan, Tenka-chan.

Tenka: Y-Yeah... thanks... um...
I'm sorry for oversleeping today.

Amana: Wh-? No need to apologize, Tenka-chan!

Tenka: But I made you go out of your way to help me...

Amana: We made it to the event on time, and the event went well, didn't it?
Besides, it was fun to help dress you up and make you cute☆

Chiyuki: I had fun doing Tenka-chan's hair, too.

Tenka: Awwuuuu... I mean... Thank you...
If you hadn't helped me... If I had been by myself... I would definitely have been late...

Chiyuki: Let's not fret about it. We help each other out.

Amana: Well said! All's well that ends well, right?

Tenka: R-Really...?

Amana: Yep! Shall we get ready to go home?

Chiyuki: Yes. Why don't we get something sweet to eat on the way?

Amana: That sounds great, doesn’t it Tenka-chan?

Tenka: Y-Yes... I'd like that...
(I've been such a bother to the others...)
(I've gotta learn how to take care of myself!)


Amana: Good morning!

Tenka: G-Good morning.

Amana: We still have plenty of time before the job. Ehehe, that's work for you!
But hang on. Doesn't your job start after Amana’s? Won't you run out of energy if you come in this early?

Tenka: Um... I decided to come earlier today... so I wouldn’t be late...

Amana: I see! I’m happy I at least get to spend more time together with you☆

Tenka: Na-Na-chan... It tickles...

Amana: Ehehe! I'll stick around until after you finish your job as well!
That way, we can go home together!

Tenka: Na-chan... Thanks...
B-But... I also have a lesson after... so if you want to go home first... it's okay...

Amana: Huh? A lesson? There was a lesson planned for today?

Tenka: Um... not to begin with...
But I specially asked for one... so I don't mess up my performance...

Amana: I see! Tenka-chan's trying her best. Amana won’t lose!
Oh, but don't do anything unreasonable! Promise?

Tenka: Okay... I won't... Thanks, Na-chan.

Amana: Ehehe! Good luck, Tenka-chan!

Chiyuki: Oh, look who's here already.

Amana: Ah, Chiyuki-san! Your job's finished? Amana will head off too then!
Chiyuki-san, Tenka-chan, see you later!

Tenka: S-See you later...

Chiyuki: See you later!
Tenka-chan, you're here really early today, aren't you?
You've been coming to lessons and work earlier than before. You're trying hard, aren't you?

Tenka: Tenka's bad at lots of stuff... so I've gotta improve...

Chiyuki: There are lots of things that only Tenka-chan can do though.
As for me, I love it when I see Tenka-chan dozing in the office!
I might have said this before, but seeing Tenka-chan sleeping happily makes me happy too.

Tenka: But... now I'm taking lessons in singing and dancing, so...

Chiyuki: I know... You're spending more time now on your lessons now.
You know, Amana-chan was just telling me how much she misses your cute sleeping face.
She's worried that you might be pushing yourself too hard.

Tenka: Na-chan said that?
She doesn't need to worry. I sleep well at night... and rest enough... so I should be okay...
Besides, I don't want to let everyone down again...

Chiyuki: Is that still bothering you?

Tenka: Y-Yeah...
Tenka doesn't want to drag Na-chan down... No... Tenka wants to stand beside her...

Chiyuki: I see... So that's how you feel...

Tenka: So... I've gotta try much harder...

Chiyuki: I see... Then I'll cheer you on!
But if there's anything I can do to help, don't hesitate to ask, okay?

Tenka: Okay, I will...
But first I want to do as much as I can on my own... At least, I want to try...

Chiyuki: Okay. Good luck, Tenka-chan!


Tenka: I'm going to try my hardest today!

Amana: Oooh, Tenka-chan's all fired up!

Tenka: Y-Yeah... I want to put on a good performance...

Chiyuki: You've been trying so hard in your lessons.

Amana: Tenka-chan's gotten so much better at singing and dancing, Amana was really surprised!

Tenka: I think I have gotten a little bit better...

Chiyuki: I think the you right now will definitely be able to have your best performance yet!

Amana: Amana thinks so too! I've seen how much work you've put into it.
There's no way today's performance won't go splendidly!

Tenka: Na-chan... Chiyuki-san... Nihehe... Thanks...

Amana: Ah, it's almost time!

Tenka: Okay... Tenka... is going to try her best!


Chiyuki: Good work, Tenka-chan.

Amana: Tenka-chan, you were dazzling☆
I mean, you're always dazzling, but today you were even more so!

Chiyuki: The singing and dancing was great, and your MC'ing was really cute too! ♪

Amana: I know, right? You were great from where we were in the wings, so it must have been even more cute for the audience☆

Tenka: Nihehe... Tenka thinks she did okay too...

Amana: Yeah! You were super-duper cute~☆

Tenka: But the only reason I could continue trying my best... in lessons... and during events...
was because Na-chan and Chiyuki-san always supported me...
S-So thank you...

Amana: That's not true! It was all your own hard work, Tenka-chan!

Chiyuki: That's right. But we're really happy if our support did help you, Tenka-chan! ♪

Tenka: Nihehe... Tenka's also happy...

Amana: Tenka-chan, are you getting sleepy?

Tenka: A lit- A little... But I'll be okay...
We should... get ready... to go home...

Amana: Hmm... But there's still time before we have to go.
You can have a quick nap before we leave, right?

Tenka: But if Tenka falls asleep here, you won't get to go home...

Chiyuki: Producer-san also said that we have some time, so I think a little nap is fine ♪
Not to mention, Tenka-chan's been working so very hard.

Tenka: B-But... won't I cause trouble for you...?

Amana: Anyone who's worked as hard as Tenka-chan has deserves some rest, don't you think?
A little nap will be fine~

Tenka: Na-chan... Okay... just a little nap...

Chiyuki: Rest well.

Tenka: Good... night... Zzz... Zzz...

Chiyuki: She's been so worked up lately, I'm sure the fatigue's finally catching up to her.

Amana: Yeah. She's really been giving it her all. You did well, Tenka-chan...

Tenka: Zzz... Zzz... Nihehe...
On stage... with Na-chan... and Chiyuki-san...

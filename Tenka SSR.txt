Tenka: Zzz... Zzz...
Amana: This one-piece is cute...
Amana: Ehehe... Tenka-chan sure sleeps a lot.
Chiyuki: Yes. It looks like she's dozing peacefully.
Tenka: Huh?
Amana: Good morning Tenka-chan.
Chiyuki: Good morning.
Tenka: G-Good morning... I lay down and fell asleep without meaning to...
Amana: Tenka-chan looked so cute when she's asleep! You were like a sleeping angel.
Tenka: A-An angel? But Tenka's just Tenka...
Amana: That's not true! You were super cute!
Chiyuki: I felt happy just watching you sleeping♪
Amana: Me too! I'm amazed how you can fall asleep anywhere, though.
Tenka: But taking naps... feels nice...
Tenka: It doesn't matter where...
Amana: Even at home, you're always napping.
Tenka: Different napping spots have different kinds of niceness to them, though.
Tenka: Take home as an example—napping in your bedroom feels completely different from napping in the living room...
Chiyuki: I see! Then which is your number one recommended napping spot?
Tenka: Eh? I'm not sure... I've never thought about it... Um...
Tenka: Napping at home is relaxing and you're free to nap as long as you like...
Tenka: But the office sofa is quite nice too... I like to take a nap there after lessons...
Tenka: Oh, but if it's sunny, I like to nap outside where it's warm...
Chiyuki: I see! Tenka-chan is quite the expert on how best to go about napping.
Amana: Listening to Tenka-chan has made Amana want to take a nap now!
Tenka: Then...  how about we nap together... sometime...
Amana: Why not? Napping together sounds like it might be a novel experience.
Chiyuki: Sounds great!
Tenka: Nihehe... Oh!
Tenka: There's somewhere where I've always wanted to try napping in...
Amana: Where? Where?
Tenka: Um... a hammock...
Amana: Ooh~ I see! You see them on TV a lot, don't you? It might be fun!
Tenka: Swaying from side to side as you fall asleep sounds nice...
Tenka: But I've never actually seen one...
Chiyuki: Nor have I... It's not everyday that you come across a hammock.
Tenka: I thought I'd like to try it...
Tenka: So that's why... I thought we could... 
Tenka: try sleeping in a hammock... if that's okay...
Amana: Yes, that sounds really fun!!
Chiyuki: The three of us swaying in a hammock... It does sound fun!
Tenka: Nihehe... I think so too...
Amana: But where could we find a hammock?
Chiyuki: Oh, that reminds me! I've heard that there are hammock cafes...
Amana: Such cafes exist?! Maybe there's one nearby. Let's search!
Tenka: Hammock... Nihehe... Swaying, swaying... It must feel nice...
Amana: Not something you can experience in a plain-old futon, is it? I guess we'll be sleeping together, then?
Chiyuki: Sounds fun!
Tenka: Fuwa... I didn't know they had cafes this big...
Amana: If it's for you, Tenka-chan, as long as it exists, I'll find it☆
Tenka: Na-chan! Thank you!
Tenka: Sleeping together... Nihehe, I can't wait...
Amana: Is Tenka-chan still not here? I wonder if Producer-san's arrived yet.
Chiyuki: Yeah, I'm a bit worried.
Chiyuki: Producer-san did say he'd be picking her up so we shouldn't worry...
Amana: I would have accompanied her if my schedule allowed...
Amana: If we don't get started soon we'll be late...
Chiyuki: Oh... It's Producer-san.
Chiyuki: Hello. It's Kuwayama speaking. Yes... Yes... I see!
Chiyuki: Excellent. We'll be waiting.
Amana: What did Producer-san say?
Chiyuki: He said he's on the way and should be arriving shortly.
Amana: Phew! We should just about make it then.
Chiyuki: But apparently Tenka-chan overslept and didn't have time to prepare...
Chiyuki: So we need to get ready to receive Tenka-chan as soon as she arrives!
Amana: Ehehe, absolutely.

Tenka: A-Awwuuu... N-Na-chan, Chiyuki-san, I'm sorry... Tenka's still in pyjamas... I can't go to work like this...
Chiyuki: Good morning, Tenka-chan. Worry not, for we're here to help.
Amana: Tenka-chan, over here! We're ready for you☆
Tenka: O-Okay...
Tenka: Um... Um, Tenka is... How should... What's happening...
Chiyuki: It's okay. Have a seat. I'll start by doing your hair.
Chiyuki: Wow... Tenka-chan's hair is so beautiful...
Tenka: I-It is...>
Amana: I know right? I mean, she does use the same shampoo as me☆
Amana: Tenka-chan, open your mouth. I'm going to brush your teeth, okay?
Tenka: U-Uh... Fuwa...
Chiyuki: And done. Doesn't your hair feel good?
Amana: Wow, Chiyuki, you're amazing! Tenka-chan's gotten even cuter!
Chiyuki: Alright, we're all ready! Let's go off to work!
Tenka: W-Will we be late...?
Amana: Don't worry, we're just on time!
Tenka: Thank goodness... If Na-chan says so... everything will be okay...
Tenka: T-Thank you for your hard work...
Amana: You too~☆ It's good that it went smoothly.
Chiyuki: Yes. Thank you, Amana-chan, Tenka-chan.
Tenka: Y-Yeah... thanks... um...
Tenka: I'm sorry for oversleeping today.
Amana: Wh-? No need to apologise, Tenka-chan!
Tenka: But I made you go out of your way to help me...
Amana: We made it to the event on time, didn't we? And the event went well, didn't it?
Amana: Besides, it was fun to help you become the cute Tenka-chan we know and love☆
Chiyuki: I had fun doing Tenka-chan's hair, too.
Tenka: Awwuuuu... I mean... Thank you...
Tenka: If you hadn't helped me... If I had been by myself... I would definitely have been late...
Chiyuki: Let's not fret about could-have-beens. We share each other's burdens.
Amana: Well said! All's well that ends well, right?
Tenka: R-Really...?
Amana: Yep! Let's get ready to go home.
Chiyuki: Yes. Why don't we get something sweet to eat on the way?
Amana: Oh my gosh yes! How does that sound, Tenka-chan?
Tenka: Y-Yes... I'd like that...
Tenka: (I've been such a bother to the others...)
Tenka: (I've gotta learn how to take care of myself!)

Amana: Good morning!
Tenka: G-Good morning.
Amana: We still have plenty of time before the job. Ehehe, that's work for you!
Amana: But hang on. Doesn't your job start after mine? Won't you run out of energy if you come in this early?
Tenka: Um... I decided to come earlier today... so as not to be late...
Amana: I see! Then at least I get to spend more time together with you☆
Tenka: Na-Na-chan... It tickles...
Amana: Ehehe! I'll stick around until after you finish your job as well!
Amana: That way, we can go home together!
Tenka: Na-chan... Thanks...
Tenka: B-But... I also have a lesson after... so if you want to go home first... it's okay...
Amana: Huh? A lesson? There was a lesson planned for today?
Tenka: Um... not to begin with...
Tenka: But I specially asked for one... so I don't mess up my performance...
Amana: I see! Tenka-chan's trying her best. I'd better stay sharp too!
Amana: Oh, but don't do anything unreasonable! Promise?
Tenka: Okay... I won't... Thanks, Na-chan.
Amana: Ehehe! Good luck, Tenka-chan!
Chiyuki: Oh, look who's here already.
Amana: Ah, Chiyuki-san! Your job's finished? I'm off to mine, then!
Amana: Chiyuki-san, Tenka-chan, see you later!
Tenka: S-See you later...
Chiyuki: See you later!
Chiyuki: Tenka-chan, you're here really early today, aren't you?
Chiyuki: You've been coming to lessons and work earlier than before. You're trying hard, aren't you?
Tenka: Tenka's bad a lots of stuff... but I've gotta get better...
Chiyuki: There are lots of things that only Tenka-chan can do, though.
Chiyuki: As for me, I love it when I see Tenka-chan dozing in the office!
Chiyuki: I might have said this before, but seeing Tenka-chan sleeping happily makes me happy too.
Tenka: But... now I'm taking lessons in singing and dancing, so...
Chiyuki: I know... You're spending more time now on your lessons now.
Chiyuki: You know, Amana-chan was just telling me how much she misses your cute sleeping face.
Chiyuki: She's worried that you might be pushing yourself too hard.
Tenka: Na-chan said that?
Tenka: She doesn't need to worry. I sleep well at night... so I should be okay...
Tenka: Besides, I don't want to let everyone down again...
Chiyuki: Is that still bothering you?
Tenka: Y-Yeah...
Tenka: Tenka doesn't want to drag Na-chan down... No... Tenka wants to stand beside her...
Chiyuki: I see... So that's how you feel...
Tenka: So I've gotta try much harder...
Chiyuki: I see... Then I'll cheer you on!
Chiyuki: But if there's any way I can help, don't hesitate to tell me, okay?
Tenka: Okay, I will...
Tenka: But first I want to do as much as I can on my own... At least, I want to try...
Chiyuki: Okay. Good luck, Tenka-chan!

Tenka: I'm going to try my darndest today!
Amana: Oooh, Tenka-chan's all fired up!
Tenka: Y-Yeah... I want to put on a good performance...
Chiyuki: You've been trying so hard in your lessons.
Amana: Tenka-chan's gotten much better at singing and dancing. It really surprised me!
Tenka: I think I have gotten a little bit better...
Chiyuki: Look at you now! I think your performance today will be your best one yet!
Amana: So do I! I've seen how much work you've put into it.
Amana: There's no way today's performance won't go splendidly!
Tenka: Na-chan... Chiyuki-san... Thanks...
Amana: Ah, it's almost time!
Tenka: Okay... Tenka... is going to try her best!

Chiyuki: Good work, Tenka-chan.
Amana: Tenka-chan, you were dazzling☆
Amana: I mean, you're always dazzling, but today you were even more so!
Chiyuki: The singing and dancing was great, and your MC'ing was really cute too! ♪
Amana: I know, right? You were great from where we were in the wings, but it must have been even more cute for the audience☆
Tenka: Nihehe... Tenka thinks she did okay too...
Amana: Yeah! You were super duper cute~☆
Tenka: But the only reason I could continue to try my best... in lessons... and during my events...
Tenka: was because Na-chan and Chiyuki-san supported me...
Tenka: S-So thank you...
Amana: That's not true! We cheered you on because you were trying so hard, Tenka-chan!
Chiyuki: That's right. But we're really happy if our support did help you, Tenka-chan! ♪
Tenka: Nihehe... Tenka's also happy...
Amana: Tenka-chan, are you getting sleepy?
Tenka: A lit- A little... But I'll be okay...
Tenka: We should... get ready... to go home...
Amana: Hmm... But there's still time before we have to go.
Amana: Enough time for you have a quick nap, I think?
Tenka: But if Tenka falls asleep here, you won't get to go home...
Chiyuki: Producer-san also said that we have some time, so I think a little nap is fine ♪
Chiyuki: Not to mention, Tenka-chan's been working so very hard.
Tenka: B-But... won't I cause trouble for you...?
Amana: Anyone who's worked as hard as you have deserves some rest, don't you think?
Amana: A little nap will be fine~
Tenka: Na-chan... Okay... just a little nap...
Chiyuki: Rest well.
Tenka: Good... night... Zzz... Zzz...
Chiyuki: She's been so worked up lately, I'm sure the fatigue's finally catching up to her.
Amana: Yeah. She's really given it her all. You did well, Tenka-chan...
Tenka: Zzz... Zzz... Nihehe...
Tenka: On stage... with Na-chan... and Chiyuki-san...
